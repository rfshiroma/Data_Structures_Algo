# Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the shortest-path distances from a single source. We assume that e.element() for edge e represents the weight of that edge

# Relaxation procedure: In order to analyse if there may be a new and better way to get v via u, it takes an old estimate and checks if it can be improved to get closer to its true value;
# We assume that e.element() for edge e represents the weight of that edge (nonnegative intergers).

    Graph g can be undirected or directed, but must be weighted (>= 0) such that e.element() returns a numeric weight for each edge e.
