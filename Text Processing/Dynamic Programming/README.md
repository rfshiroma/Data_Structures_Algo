# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

## Dynamic Programming
* The components of a Dynamic Programming Solution
 1. Simple Subproblems: Find a way to break the global optimization problem into subproblems repeatedly. In addition, create a table in order to represent/describe subproblems with just a few indices, such as i, j, k, and so on.
 2. Subproblem Optimization: An optimal solution to the global problem must be a composition of optimal subproblem solutions.
 3. Subproblem Overlap: Optimal solutions to unrelated subproblems can contain subproblems in common.
